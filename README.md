##     <p align = "left"> Introduction 📚 </p>

Like many pet owners, I've faced a common problem:<br>every time I leave the house, my dogs jump on the sofa and leave behind a mess of fur 🐾🛋️. <br>I've tried countless methods to prevent this but to no avail.<br><br>
Motivated to find a solution, I decided to leverage the power of technology to create a tool to manage this issue. I developed a system that combines computer vision, machine learning, and object detection. The result? A tool that alerts 🚨 whenever it detects one of the dogs on the sofa, causing them to get off.

<br>

##     <p align = "left"> Implementation 💻 </p>
The system utilizes the YOLOv8 pre-trained model from Ultralytics. <br>I made several modifications, computations, and conditions to tailor the model for this specific application.

<br>

##     <p align = "left"> Features ⭐ </p>
 -  Real-time detection of a specific event: dog climbing on a couch.
 -  Utilizes the powerful YOLOv8 model for object detection.
 -  Triggers real-time alerts when the event is detected.

<br>

##     <p align = "left"> Installation and Usage 🛠️ </p>
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Position your computer in front of the couch. It's preferable if the computer's camera is parallel to the couch.
4. Run the script 'python detector.py'
5. The tool will then use your computer's camera to monitor the couch.
6. The tool has been programmed to specifically detect dogs, cats, sofas, and beds while ignoring other objects.
<br>
Note: While this was built with my dogs in mind, this tool could theoretically be applied to cats or any other pets that are fond of lounging on your furniture.

<br><br>

##     <p align = "left"> Conclusion and Request for Feedback 📝 </p>
I hope that this tool will solve my problem. But even if it doesn't fully work as expected, I've thoroughly enjoyed the learning journey and the deep dive into the world of computer vision and object detection.<br><br>
This is my first project using the YOLO model, so I welcome any feedback regarding the implementation, the code quality, and any potential optimizations that could ensure efficient runtimes even on relatively weak hardware. Your time and insights are greatly appreciated. <br>Thank you! 🙏

<br>

##     <p align = "left"> Future Updates 🔮 </p>
Stay tuned for future updates, enhancements, and the results of this project. I'll be posting regular updates as we progress. Thanks for stopping by! 👋

<br>

##     <p align = "left"> Acknowledgements 🙏 </p>
I'd like to express my gratitude to the creators of the YOLOv8 model, as their work served as the foundation for this project.
